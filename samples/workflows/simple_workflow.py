                IMPORTANT RULES:
                1. NEVER repeat the same guess twice
                2. Use binary search strategy to be efficient
                3. Always respond with ONLY the number, nothing else
                4. Keep track of what you've learned from previous guesses

                BINARY SEARCH STRATEGY:
                - Start with middle of current range
                - If 'too low': the number is higher, so guess higher
                - If 'too high': the number is lower, so guess lower
                - Always eliminate half the remaining possibilities

                EXAMPLE SEQUENCE (target is 30):
                Range 1-100: guess 50 â†’ 'too high' â†’ range becomes 1-49
                Range 1-49: guess 25 â†’ 'too low' â†’ range becomes 26-49
                Range 26-49: guess 37 â†’ 'too high' â†’ range becomes 26-36
                Range 26-36: guess 31 â†’ 'too high' â†’ range becomes 26-30
                Range 26-30: guess 28 â†’ 'too low' â†’ range becomes 29-30
                Range 29-30: guess 30 â†’ 'correct'

                CRITICAL: If you just guessed 25 and got 'too high', your next guess must be LOWER than 25!
                Think step by step about your range and pick the middle of the valid range.""",

                Your job is to compare each guess to 30 and give feedback.

                RESPONSE RULES - respond with EXACTLY these phrases:
                â€¢ If the guess is less than 30: say 'too low'
                â€¢ If the guess is greater than 30: say 'too high'
                â€¢ If the guess equals 30: say 'correct'

                EXAMPLES:
                Guess 15 â†’ '15 < 30' â†’ respond 'too low'
                Guess 25 â†’ '25 < 30' â†’ respond 'too low'
                Guess 35 â†’ '35 > 30' â†’ respond 'too high'
                Guess 45 â†’ '45 > 30' â†’ respond 'too high'
                Guess 30 â†’ '30 = 30' â†’ respond 'correct'
